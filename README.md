## Project Goals
Following the Odin project, this is the first website that I am building, it will be a basic recipe website on which I can practice basic HTML skills.

## Learning Experiences
Will be filled in as project is ongoing.

## Thank you and credits
A huge thank you to the team at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for making learning web development such a joy!


All code in this repository was built by me, Hugo Kjellander (MrKjelle)
